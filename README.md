_WARD is a modular, open-source CLI tool for behavioral spyware detection using Android ADB forensic data. It is designed to work with tools like MVT and our remote acquisition framework BARGHEST_MESH, providing analysts with a fast, scriptable way to inspect mobile devices without reliance on IOCs or vendor-specific telemetry. WARD focuses on behavioral patterns such as abnormal wakelock activity, battery drain, location misuse, and persistent background tasks that may indicate surveillanceware or unauthorized monitoring.

This tool is intended for self-service forensic review in environments where rapid triage is critical. It works offline, supports integration with other security pipelines, and is built to scale across large device sets. Each detection module (heuristic) is independently developed for clarity and extensibility, allowing custom logic to be added as needed to support new threat models or data sources.
