_WARD is a modular, open-source tool for behavioral spyware detection using Android ADB forensic data. It is designed to perform analysis on logs from an Android device, utlitizing crash logs, processes & threads, system diagnostics, wifi manager logs & installed applications. The tool combined provides a self-service spyware detection kiosk that can detect the presence of malicious code on a device without the need for signatures. This provides civil society actors with a fast and easy way to inspect mobile devices without reliance on IOCs or vendor-specific telemetry. WARD focuses on behavioral patterns such as abnormal wakelock activity, battery drain, location misuse, and persistent background tasks that may indicate surveillanceware or unauthorized monitoring.

In combination with our remote acquisition framework BARGHEST_MESH, a remote DFIR acqusition tool, both tools provide a means for which spyware can be detected and a forensics specialist can respond. 

This tool is intended for self-service forensic review in environments where rapid triage is critical. It works offline, supports integration with other security pipelines, and is built to scale across large device sets. Each detection module (heuristic) is independently developed for clarity and extensibility, allowing custom logic to be added as needed to support new threat models or data sources.
